* Purpose
This program will simulate several different batch scheduling algorithms using
the CIEMAT dataset. This is a project as part of my High Performance Computing
class at NAU.
* Compilation
This program was compiled and tested using both g++ 7.5.0 and g++ 6.2.0
(available on Monsoon via "load module gcc/6.2.0").

A makefile is provided in this repo.
* Execution
Usage: ./a.out <data-file> <number-of-jobs> <algorithm>
        <data-file>: the path of the CEA-Curie-2011-2.swf dataset
        <number-of-jobs>: the number of jobs to read from the SWF file
        <algorithm>: three algorithms are supported {FCFS, SJF, and LJF}
        FCFS --> First Come First Serve, SJF --> Shortest Job First, LJF --> Longest Job First
