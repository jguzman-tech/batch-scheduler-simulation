* IMPORTANT
Fields 10,16,17,18 are always -1 because they are "unavailable". These
correspond to mem_req, partition, prior_job, and think_time.

Fields 13 and 14 are -1 when the owner cannot be identified, these are always failed
jobs. But apparently this only happens when there is a system failure. These
correspond to gid and executable.
* I need a global timer
Do not add a job to the job queue if the global time is less than the submit
time, everything should already be in the order of submit time.
